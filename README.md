## About GTFS

[GTFS](https://gtfs.org) is the industry standard for publishing public transit schedules. It's used for metro and bus systems throughout the world, but any scheduled or on-demand service can be represented in this format. This GTFS feed allows for the seaplane flights to appear in trip planning apps like [Transit](https://transit.app) and many others. While flights are rarely represented using GTFS, doing so allows for trip planning involving onward connections to Vancouver's SkyTrain, and the bus systems in the other destination cities.
